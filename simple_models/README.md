# Instructions for .bnet files

A .bnet file contains a single line for every component. 

Each line consists of the name of the variable that is being defined, separated by a comma from the Boolean expression that defines its update function. 

For practical examples, refer to the [PDF with simple models](https://github.com/fpaleixo/arbolom/blob/main/simple_models/simple_models.pdf), where each model's .bnet representation can be seen at the side of the respective model, or refer to the .bnet files present in this folder.
